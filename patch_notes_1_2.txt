### PATCH NOTES LotusAI release 1.2
# Added a decision to Netherlands that will annex all of Dutch East Indies subjects into DEI, and turn DEI into a puppet. It requires Nationalism, and the AI will take it.
# Added a decision to Great Britain that will annex all of British Raj subjects into British Raj. It is available once the Raj tag is activated fpr East India Company. (usually like 20-30 years into the game the AI gets it)
# These new decisions I feel are necessary due to the backwards mechanics behind annexing vassals. The AI does not understand that it needs to reduce relations with its overlord in order ot be able annex its own subjects, and barely understands needing to reduce reduce relations with the subject it wants to annex. The mechanic itself is counter-intuitive, because good relations should be a good thing, and in games like EU4 you annex vassals with good relations, not poor ones. This is why Britain likes to annex Quebec at the game start in LotusAI, for example. (I haven't specifically blocked this yet because it doesnt' block Canada from forming and anything that buffs Britain is good imo) A small bonus to performance from removing something like 20-30 tags from the game after the early game as well.
# Integrated some ideas and several bug fixes from the following two mods (integrated into LotusAI, you don't need these mods)

# The biggest change is that AI will capitulate at 0 War Exhaustion, because White Peace is a completely broken mechanic that does not function. Some other variables have been adjusted to compensate for this.
# More general improvements to specific country behaviors. 
# The AI should be more concerned about conquering contiguous territory.
# The AI will weight obligations from small countries lower; Russia and Austria won't defend every other german minor, for example.
# I *think* I finally fixed Britain & Raj fighting each other (issue in previous versions of LotusAI) Let me know if you see this happening.
