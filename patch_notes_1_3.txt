### PATCH NOTES LotusAI release 1.3
# Fixed Austrian and Ottoman over-aggression. These two unfortunately are not as internally unstable as they should be in vanilla, and I don't want to start modding political stuff.
# Fixed Europeans sometimes still going after South American countries.
# Fixed French/British/Russian over-aggresion in Europe.
# Fixed American over-aggression into Mexico and Canada. Should still be possible they might puppet Mexico or take some/all of Canada, but it should not be frequent or standard, at least not in the first half of the game.
# To summarize above, should not see Dutch Venezuela, French Sweden, Russian Belgium, etc. anymore. America might go bigger than IRL but should not be as overzealous as before.
# Fixed a bug with Russian AI implementation, it should now properly go after central asia in a reasonable timeframe.
# Updates to AI wargoal prioritization.
# Not 100% certain if this is functiong or not, but it should be possible for an AI to support an uprising of it's culture in another country now. They sometimes don't like to support it even if they can. (Players can as well)
