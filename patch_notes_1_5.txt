### PATCH NOTES LotusAI release 1.5

# Removed the rework to war exhaustion and attempted to rebalance peace deal values to work as intended in vanilla. Capitulation no longer happens at 0 War Support. I have it set to -25% instead of the default -100% now. I am very frustrated with the Peace Deal system overall tbh and the result is not ideal, but neiter was my hacky workaround. The new update's behavior better than vanilla but not perfect, as it is fundamentally broken. (see https://www.reddit.com/r/victoria3/comments/z0grji/i_have_actually_learned_how_peace_deals_work_or/ )

# Further general refining of AI wargoal logic, some things country-specific some things broad. Though this bullet point is short this is the biggest change in this patch & where 90% of the time spent on this patch was went. (including fixing bugs in existing logic) Some major under the hood re-wiring has been done and the results should be a noticable improvement over previous mod version. The AI should seem less aggressive than prior version, while still going after & achieving logical goals.

# The AI will now use Liberate Country CB against Ottomans, Austria & Egypt but no one else. I forgot that I had disabled AI use of this CB in an earier update of the mod; it definitely is nicer not having the AI use this against most countries imo. While it doesn't line up with how it happened historically, this causes Ottomans & Austria to end up breaking up over the course of the game as they lose wars with liberate country CBs on them. NOTE: So far as I can tell, there is no way to obtain any information about the country being liberated. So I can't stop for example landlocked countries inside of Austria from being liberated. Although this will introduce some border-gore it hopefully should sort itself out by the end of a game. This also serves as a way for the other Great Powers to whittle down Austria and Ottomans, nerfing AI Austria in particular.

# Added a Russian claim to the state Kars (Ottoman held on the border with Ottomans, historically taken by Russia)

# Removed Nationalism requirement from the mod's "Centralize Dutch East Indies" decision. This means it is useable right away and DEI will instantly annex it's starting vassals. The reason for this change is that in perhaps 50% of test games, Dutch East Indies loses it's starting vassals and the reason is that it's power ranking drops to Insignificant Power. That instantly causes its puppets to automatically release. I don't think this is moddable, and it happens in vanilla too, so I am just unrestricting this as a workaround.

# The decentralized nations in New Zealand have been removed & consolodated into the United Tribes tag. This is the best solution I could think of for now as to how to stop USA from taking South Island every game. (As they need the interest in Oceania in order to get Hawaii) There is no way to limit where countries colonize other than strategic regions.

# Removed Miskito Kingdom protectorate from Great Britain as it would sometimes cause GBR to get dragged into a pointless war with the US.

# USA should actually get Hawaii now; fixed an issue related to the logic I had here.

# Cape Colony is now a Dominion instead of a Puppet so it can do things on it's own.

# USA & Brazil both start with 5 extra Barracks in their capitals to help them win their initial wars as AI (Brazil in particular needed help, USA was losing a little more often than I'd like, but it's not abhorrent for Mexico to win).

# The level 10 Barracks in Ankara is upgraded to level 30. Additionally, Adana is now fully owned by Ottomans at game start.

##### The following changes are all to help with AI use of the Liberate Country CB being enabled specifically & only on Ottomans, Austria & Egypt (disabled in all other cases, players can use it freely) #####

# Bosnia now will get Montenegro when released from a country. This is to prevent pocket of Otttoman territory in the Balkans after countries are released.

# Albania now will get Southern Serbia when released from a country. This is to prevent pocket of Otttoman territory in the Balkans after countries are released.

# Translyvania now will get Moldavia when released from a country. This is to prevent pocket of Austrian territory after countries are released.

# Sudan now will get Eritrea when released from a country.

# Trieste & Slovenia are no longer releasable tags.

# Slovakia is no longer a releasable country. So far as I can tell there is no way to control what country is chosen by the AI when choosing "release country" CB, and Slovakia is often picked if able & fully landlocked inside of Austria.

# Transjordan & Lebanon are no longer releasable tags.
