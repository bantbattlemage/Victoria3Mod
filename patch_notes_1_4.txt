### PATCH NOTES LotusAI release 1.5

# Removed the rework to war exhaustion and attempted to rebalance peace deal values to work as intended in vanilla. Capitulation no longer happens at 0 War Support. I have it set to -25% instead of the default -100% now. In my testing the AI should now actually accept peace deals without the other side needing to capitulate and most wars that don't involve an occupied capital will actually end without one side needing to hit the capitulation threshold. They can still be stubborn though, and this will definitely need furthe refinement. (Or a Paradox patch to make peace deals not suck, please) I think this solution is better and is much closer to vanilla, though I miss knowing exactly when someone would capitulate.

# Further general refining of AI wargoal logic. There is a lot fine-tuning going on at this stage & working on solving later-game scenarios mainly now.

# The AI will now use Liberate Country CB against Ottomans, Austria & Egypt but no one else. I forgot that I had disabled AI use of this CB in an earier update of the mod; it definitely is nicer not having the AI use this against most countries imo. While it doesn't line up with how it happened historically, this causes Ottomans & Austria to end up breaking up over the course of the game as they lose wars with liberate country CBs on them.

# Removed Nationalism requirement from the mod's "Centralize Dutch East Indies" decision. This means it is useable right away and DEI will instantly annex it's starting vassals. The reason for this change is that in perhaps 50% of test games, Dutch East Indies loses it's starting vassals, and the reason is that it's power ranking drops to a Insignificant Power and that causes its puppets to automatically release. I don't think this is moddable, and it happens in vanilla too, so I am just unrestricting this as a workaround.
