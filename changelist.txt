### General AI Behavior Changes ###
# The AI should in general declare wars much more often than it did before and be much better at creating the games main formable tags.
# THe AI should be somewhat more reasonable/realistic in what it demands in war goals. At least more player-like. Particularly, there should be less border-gore.
# The AI should attempt to pass laws more frequently.
# The AI should be much more aggressive with it's generals, recruiting more generals and splitting armies into smaller stacks so it can both defend & attack.
# The AI will naval invade much more frequently and aggressively than before, and should not get stuck in wars because it has to do a naval invasion and can't figure out how.
# The AI will seek to annex vassals that it can and will seek to subjugate weak countries that it can.
# The AI should be less inclined to sit in a stalemated war forever without white peacing.
# The AI should be quicker to accept peace when it has lost a war.

### Game Start Changes ###
# Removed all starting treaty ports except Macau. (They are just no longer treaty ports, the tiles are still owned by their respective overlords)
# Parma, Lucca, and Modena have been removed from Austria's Custom Union because Austria will very often retain a deathgrip on them even if Italy forms. This helps Italy integrate all of the minors more consistently.
# The borders between the Mexico, the US and Canada have been adjusted to allow for the AI to consistently recreate clean borders. The changes here are rather subtle but make a big difference. There is slightly less uncolonized land due to this though.
# Mexico & the USA start at war along with Texas, with wargoals on the USA claims.
# Mindanao in the Phillipines now starts fully owned by Spanish Phillipines, because the AI very rarely chooses to ever colonize the last bit of the Phillipines and that small tag adds nothing meaningful to the game.
# Western Australia now starts fully owned by Western Australia, because the AI very rarely (never?) chooses to colonize this bit of Australia and that small tag adds nothing meaningful to the game.
# Hokkaido now starts fully owned by Japan.
# Added Russian claims to the 2 central Asian states that are fully enclosed in the Caucuses. 
# The level 40 Barracks in Lower Egypt has been reduced to level 10 to help Ottomans not get curbstomped quite so badly and consisetly.
# Mexico has been given two level 5 naval bases because as AI it somtiimes liked to declare war on caribeean countries without realizing it doesn't have the boats to do so. I'd prefer to fix the root issue here, but that is TBD.
# A level 10 naval base has added to Western Java for Dutch East Indies because it had zero before.

### Event/Decision Changes ###
# The Heavenly Kingdom war now starts instantly after choosing a decision in the corresponding event, and Heavenly Kingdom gets an Annex wargoal on Qing. The AI *shouldn't* force Qing to release Heavenly Kingdom after it wins... but I wouldn't be surprised if this isn't fully fixed yet.
# The Alaska Purchase & Canadian Border Treaty both now require Neutral relations instead of Cordial. This is mainly to help the AI, thoug it technically makes things easier for the player it is trivial.
# The American Civil war (when it starts by event) now give both sides an annex cb.
# Great Britain now has a copy of Netherlands decision to give territory to East India Company that the AI will automatically take.
