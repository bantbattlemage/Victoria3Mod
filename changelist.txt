### Game Start State Ownership Changes ###
# Removed Pondicherry's treaty port status. (Beware AI France claming a new treaty port from East India Company however, lol. It happened several times in my tests; the AI knows it's busted I guess.)
# Removed Goa's treaty port status.
# Removed Oman's treaty port in Baluchistan.
# Hokkaido now starts fully owned by Japan.
# Mexican Colorado is now owned by the US, because the US absolutely refuses to take the split state in a peace deal & would rather leave a Mexican exclave inside it's borders forever.
# The Commanche provinces in Kansas and Oklahoma given to Indian Territory to prevent Mexican colony islands forming.
# The Blackfoot decentralized provinces have been split between Hudson Bay Company & the US to create a clean border between them.
# Mindanao in the Phillipines now starts fully owned by Spanish Phillipines, because the AI very rarely chooses to ever colonize the last bit of the Phillipines.
# Western Australia now starts fully owned by Western Australia, because the AI very rarely (never?) chooses to colonize this bit of Australia. Australia will actually form because of this.
# Added French claims to Algeria and Constantine to encourage French AI to take them.
# Added Russian claims to the central Asian states to encourage Russian AI to take them. 
# Added Dutch East Indies claims to all of it's historical territory to encourage the AI to take them.

### Game Start Building Changes ###
# The level 40 Barracks in Lower Egypt has been reduced to level 10 to help Ottomans win the war against them.

### Game Start Diplomacy Changes ###
# Parma, Lucca, and Modena have been removed from Austria's Custom Union because Austria will very often retain a deathgrip on them even if Italy forms. This helps Italy integrate all of the minors.
# Added a Rivalry between the USA and Mexico at game start. (They seem to drop it pretty often though.)

### Specific AI Strategy Changes ###
# Set Great Britain/East India Company AI to desire to conquer Burma and Malaya.
# Set France AI to desire to conquer Algeria.
# Changed Egypt AI's attitute toward Ottomans from Conquer to None. This causes them to not take territory as aggressively even if they win the war.
# Set Netherlands & Dutch East Indies AI to desire to conquer Indonesian minors.
# Set Dutch East Indies AI and East India Company AI to seek to befriend each other.
# Set Russia AI to desire to conquer the central Asian minors.
# Set Prussia AI to desure to befriend Sardinia & Sicily and vice versa.
# Set Great Britain AI to desire to befriend Prussia & vice versa.
# Set Italy AI to desire to conquer Italian states.
# Expanded the states that USA cares about in it's modifiers with Mexico.
# Russia AU no longer has a "Conquer" goal on the Ottomans. (They are still Rivals, but this will change what Russia AI takes in peace deals)
# Sardinia and Two Sicilys AI now desire to conquer the other Italian minors.
# Set Hedjaz AI to attempt to conquer the Arabian peninsula.

### General AI Strategy Changes ###
# The AI should in general declare more wars than it did before.
# The AI should spend more of it's available Manuevers in a Diplomatic Play.
# The AI should attempt to pass laws more frequently.
# The AI should more more frequently set Return State war goals.
# The AI should more more frequently set Dominion/Puppet/Vassal war goals.
